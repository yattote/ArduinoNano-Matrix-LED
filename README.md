## Features
- Configurable matrix size by attaching multiple Dot Matrixes
- Configurable marquees and animations to display
- Interactive games through joystick

### Hardware components used for Led Cube

- Arduino [Nano](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano) or compatible
- 8x8 dot matrix LEDs model 1088AS with MAX7219 in [FC-16](https://majicdesigns.github.io/MD_MAX72XX/page_f_c16.html) boards
- Battery or powerbank [ 5V,  +2200 mAh ]
- Optional joystick analog 2-Axis with button for interactive games
- Optional switch button
- Optional dip switch to turn on/off the cube
- Matrix structure, up to your imagination

### Software structure

The software is splitted into [Abstraction Layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_layer) so the responsability of each layer are very limited and will make easier the growth and maintenance of the project in a Architectural point of view. Using a objected-oriented language such as C++ accepted by Arduino, makes the implementation closer to this approach.
